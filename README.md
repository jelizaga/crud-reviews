> I spent around 3 days hunting down a bug with Parse, only to realize it was because I was sending
integers to a column that was designated for strings. The error code couldn't be found in their JS
error code list. For some reason getReviews() won't call on the js file or html. I had raty
working, but that appears to have dropped in a recent commit.
