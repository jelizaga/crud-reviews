> No.
##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> Since Saturday.
##### Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> I spent around 3 days hunting down a bug with Parse, only to realize it was because I was sending
integers to a column that was designated for strings. The error code couldn't be found in their JS
error code list. I don't know what could make this challenge better. Maybe we should spend more
time on jQuery? This seemed like a pretty far leap from the leaflet challenge.
